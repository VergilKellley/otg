				<p>This organization views their clients as family. OTG Sports goes above the call of duty in many areas, and they are men of their word. I feel so grateful that my son is with a caring agency that has his back. This firm looks out for their clients and have their best interest at heart. If you want an agency that will answer all your questions, no matter what time of day it is, someone that is easy to communicate with, someone who will represent their clients’ best interest, then OTG Sports Management is for you.</p>

				<h5>Alex McGough</h5>
				<p>Chris and his team at OTG Sports were an invaluable source of information throughout the draft process. From day 1, they walked us through the process and informed us of everything we needed to know. The entire staff did a phenomenal job promoting our son Alex. With Alex coming out of a small market school, OTG did a great job getting his name in front of the people that needed to see it.  Chris was always available to answer any questions we had, which made what could have been a very stressful time much more comfortable. We can’t thank Chris and OTG enough for all they did!</p>

				<h5>Wilkerson</h5>
				<p>The path to the NFL is not an easy path and neither was choosing the agent/agency to represent my son and our family. We were fortunate to meet and speak with numerous agents. So when it came time to choose, we were able to compare each agency/agent. My son and I had no reservations about choosing Chris and the OTG family to represent him. What stood out the most with Chris was the fact that he is a family man and family is very important to him. Chris and the OTG family have been nothing short of an extended family to us. My son and my family are truly grateful to have chosen the OTG family to represent us! </p>
 
				<p>Forever grateful,</p>

				<h5>Trey Johnson</h5>
				<p>Mom and Dad, I’m gonna play in the NFL! Every parent of an athlete hears those words sooner or later but when it happens your kind of lost. High school was a breeze, the college recruiting process added some strain but really wasn't that complicated. However, nothing could really prepare you for the NFL process. You need a trusted partner to help guide you through the process. You have questions about combines, 40 times, what to say to a team if they call, how do contracts work, who’s really interested, how do you get on the radar when you are from a small school? Though you have questions, the answers start by selecting the right agent/representative. This is the most important step and will determine the future of your athlete. The agent is the person representing your athlete behind closed doors to executives and coaches. What will he say in your absence? Does he have my kid's best interest? What kind of industry reputation does he have? This decision in my personal opinion is not one you hastily enter into but you must be prayerful about it. This is where the game changed for us and we found On The Go (OTG) Sports Management.</p>

				<p>We are Ralph and Tracy Johnson and our son Trey Johnson is currently a Pittsburgh Steeler and member of the OTG family. Yes, I said Family, because that’s what we are! Chris Martin and his team have been confidants and advocates for Trey since the first day we talked. They’ve led us through the questions and provided all Trey needed to go from college student/athlete to NFL professional. The organization is family oriented and they provide an array of services from marketing, leadership and character development, financial planning and performance training. Couple these with some expert advice, availability and analysis OTG doesn’t stop cultivating their athletes for the moment when a team calls! And they will call!</p>


				<p>Trusted, Dependable and Available are just a few words that come to mind when I think about OTG and our experience. If you are reading this and walking through the process, I encourage you to pray first and give OTG a call! Though they are “On The Go” you will get the answer you need.</p>

				<h5>M.D. Jennings </h5>
				<p>When it came time to choose a firm to represent me, I wanted to find a company that could provide me with everything I needed to help my professional career. I was looking for a company where I would not be just another player on the client list. After talking with Chris for the first time I felt like OTG was the way to go. The guys at OTG understand and respect the game and they always do what they feel is best for the athlete.</p>

				<h5>Brandon Joiner </h5>
				<p>It is every college football player’s dream to be good enough to make it to the NFL. The reality is all of them need help to get there. NFL careers are not based on talent alone. “Show Me The Money” was not just a movie. It was a literal portrayal of the life, relationship, trials and tribulations of an athlete with an agent. Imagine what it would be like without one. The use of an agent will allow the athlete time to practice, study and perform at his best.There is no athlete who knows this more than my son, Brandon Joiner.</p>

				<p>Brandon is currently being managed by OTG Sports Management. Brandon was noticed by OTG his senior year of college at Arkansas State University at the suggestion of some teammates that were already being managed by OTG.  His talent and potential caught their eye and they never gave up. OTG Sports Management Team was formed by President/CEO Chris Martin and is comprised of former athletes — they are known for the pride and passion they have for their clients which was evident in their management of Brandon. It was said that Brandon would likely not make it to the NFL. He was sentenced to serve time for trouble he was in while in college his freshman year.</p>

				<p>He needed a hardball negotiator to deal in his behalf — Chris Martin and OTG Sports Management proved to be the pitbull Brandon needed. Chris was there for Brandon through his sentencing, release and ultimately his arrival into the NFL where he landed his contract with the Cincinnati Bengals. If ever there was a management team that you want to not only “Show You The Money” but show you the support, dedication and put the needs of the athlete first and foremost, Chris Martin and OTG Sports Management is that team.</p>
