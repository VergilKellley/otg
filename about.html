				<p class="first-p">Chris Martin's love affair with football started early in life. Growing up in Tampa, FL, he attended Jesuit High School where he earned distinction as an All-State Wide Receiver and Defensive Back from 1990 to 1992. Recruited by Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, Chris became a dynamic force for the Wildcats from 1992-1996 where he was named to the All-American and All-Big Ten Teams respectively as a Defensive Back. He was a catalyst for NU's "Dream Season", taking the team to the Big 10 Championship and Rose Bowl in 1996. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree that same year.<br><br>

				Following Northwestern, Chris joined the Chicago Bears as a Defensive Back and special teams player for the 1996-1997 seasons. He managed to keep his passion for sports alive after his football career by launching a leading sports company in the Chicagoland area.<br><br>

				On-the-go Sports, Inc., developed in 1998, currently works with more than 50 park districts and sports facilities throughout Chicago and various suburban areas touching the lives of thousands of youths annually. In addition, he is the founder of Scoring For Youth, a non-profit organization designed to host free youth sports camps and clinics in inner-city areas. In an effort to build a vertical platform and expand the aforementioned companies to unchartered territories, Chris launched <span class="green-text">OTG</span> Sports Management. OTGSM has taken the Sports Management world by storm garnering instant success while carefully constructing a company that's built to last.</p>
